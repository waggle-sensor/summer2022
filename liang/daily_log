June 13th
  - Nearly finished orientation
  - Met Raj in person
  - Set up my workstation
  
June 14th
  - Finished setting up ssh key and github
  - Began reading papers suggested by Nicola
  - Began looking into pix2pix GAN model
  
June 15th
  - Read research papers on differences in wildfire smoke plumes
  - Familiarized myself with fundamentals in neural nets
  - set up docker with vscode

June 16th
  - Followed tutorials on pix2pix
  - set up training images from kaggle
  - emailed Nicola about using colab/jupyter or cloud service for building models

June 17th
  - experimented with pix2pix pre-generated models
  - used python package dataset-tools for generating canny edges from images

June 20th
  - Researched more into GANs model
  - Reached out to Nicola with regards to setting up my access to the gpu system
  
June 21st
  - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351359172_Generative_adversarial_networks_to_model_air_pollution_under_uncertainty
  - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344506117_Conditional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_to_Model_Urban_Outdoor_Air_Pollution
  - Two papers very similar to what we are trying to acheive with modeling air quality using GANs
  - alcf account was approved and gained access to the gpu system

June 22nd
  - Read more research papers on how topology and and wind directiona affect air quality
  - Emailed Nicola with list of clarification questions regarding types of input data / optimizing sensor placement
  
June 23rd
  - Attended two lectures discussing applications of DL
  - Began experimenting with modeling via ssh through the theta gpu system
  
June 27th
  - Met with Bhupendra, Dario, and Sean with regards to my project details/objectives
  - Reread the paper I sent to Nicola that gave proof of concept to the project
  - Emailed the researcher of the paper if they were willing to share their project code
  
June 28th
  - Met with Nicola over zoom to clarify detailed about GANs for AQ and optimizing sensor placement
  - Met with Dario to discuss the CGANs implementation used in the paper
  - Slacked the Oregon researchers to gain access to AQ data in Oregon
  
June 29th
  - Career Day
  
June 30th
  - Set up my vscode to experiment with CGANs model found online (shell script created)
  - First testing aroung with the MNIST dataset to experiment
  - Asked Dario about how to modify this model to mimic the research paper's
