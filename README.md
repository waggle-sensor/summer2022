# Summer 2022

Hello and welcome! Here are some links and instructions to help you around.


## Getting Started

New here?  Check out the [getting started](getting_started.md) readme.

## Slack
We will invite you to our slack workspace. Please let us know if you have not been invited. 

## Github
We recommend these tutorials if you are new to git: 

- [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

Please do not add large files to git repositories if possible. Please ask your supervisor where to put them. Please do not clone a git repository in a directory that is synced with icloud or any other sync mechanism, as files might be deleted.

### Process for Github:
- Fork the https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2022 repository.  This will create a “copy” of the repository in your own profile.  (ex. https://github.com/jswantek/summer2022)
- Clone forked repository to your machine (ex. git clone git@github.com:jswantek/summer2022.git)
- Make code changes on the main (or another branch) in your own forked environment (i.e git commit)
- Push your changes to your own forked repository (git push origin <branch>)
- Then within your fork on github create a “Pull Request”

- You will see that the proposed merge is from jswantek/summer2022:main -> waggle-sensor/summer2022:main.  Click “Create pull request”

<img src="https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2022/raw/main/resources/fork3.png" width="600"></br>

- After the change is approved, click the “Merge pull request”.  This will merge your change into the `waggle-sensor/summer2022:main along with everyone else’s work in a safe way.

- Repeat the above process for each change you want to make.


> *note:* your own fork will get “out-of-date” with the main waggle-sensor/summer2022 repository so in your forked repository in GitHub you can click the “Fetch upstream” to have the upstream repository merged into your fork. (see attached image)

## Google Drive
If you need to create documents, spreadsheets and share them, feel free to create a folder named per your lastname in our shared [Google Drive Summer2022](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dgy7P6ISU2wHp5zaTFBVIWuvf6jl_DB4) and link to your GitHub files. Send us you google email address via slack, so we can share trhat folder with you.

## Tiles 
To give you an opportunity to present yourself and to get to know the others we ask our students to fill out a google slide. You can find the template [`Student_Quadchart_Template`](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZEmAgDBynZHx24BkK2ir1YAdBqOc1ro5Wc10SVx5zQY/edit?usp=sharing) in the google drive folder above.

## Daily blogs
This is a space to keep your daily blogs and maintain a `README.md` with links to resources that may be shared using non-Git avenues. Please create a folder named per your last name.

[Here](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2018/tree/master/morrison) is an example of a student space organization. Please follow it in organizing your space.

## Presentations
In addition to the presentations mentioned under Deliverables below, we want students also to give 10-minute presentations at the beginning and midpoint of their internship. These presentations are about the goals of the internship and intermediate results. (Presentation slides do not require to follow a template)

## Deliverables

For our SULI students there are four required deliverables:

1. Oral or Poster Presentation
2. One-page peer review
3. Abstract for General Audience
4. Research Report Paper

(Detailed instructions should have been shared with these students)


For all other interns we expect at the end of their internship:

1. Oral presentation
2. Abstract for General Audience (on github)
3. A white paper OR a real publication. In either case the daily blog on github can serve as a basis for the content. 4-8 pages, please use the LaTeX template or the overleaf template. No Microsoft Word please.  [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
4. Blog-style science article 

The blog-style articles will be added to this list of science stories: [https://sagecontinuum.org/science/](https://sagecontinuum.org/science/)

Take a look at existing blog articles as examples and use the following points as a guidance:

- Who am I and what am I doing?
- Whys is what I am doing important?
- What sensors, instruments, and data am I using to solve this challenge?
- What is the approach / methodology?
- What is next?
- A brief conclusion
- Reference

This is essentially a mini paper, but more informal, like a blog.
